File Integrity Monitoring working via bash and expect scripting

Ðžne day, I was given a task - to install in organization (from 50 to 100 servers) FIM  system. After a while , I was deployed OSSEC. But then met a number of limitations. I began to think about writing my own FIM- project. The basis is simple - bash + expect scripting.
