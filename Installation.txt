Installation is simple also. 

Important (added 10/09/2016): To know how tune Windows monitoring, please see paragraph 6.
1. Unzip archive on your server (which will monitor other systems; remind you - monitoring is agentless). For quick - let it be on /opt. So the path will be /opt/fim/
2. Create sensor. For that you must:
  2.1. Create directory in /opt/fim/sensors with the name of your sensor. For example /opt/fim/sensors/my_first_server. Inside of this directory create directory "hist" (without quotes)
  2.2. Deside - how often monitoring system will initialize connections to target systems for scan. My practice - frontends must be scan every 2 min, other systems 5 min. People often blame me in paranoia, but believe me I'm not. After desiding - write your sensor name in one of config - /opt/check_conf_age/2min.conf or /opt/check_conf_age/5min.conf. IMPORTANT: at the end of the file always must be empty line!!! IT'S IMPORTANT !!! DON'T FORGET!!!
  2.3. In /opt/fim/bin 2 scripts - fim_2min.sh and fim_5min.sh. Edit one of them. We are interested in lines looks like:
    /opt/fim/scripts/Linux/Linux.sh... <some parameters>
    The format of this line for *nix systems is:
    /opt/fim/scripts/Linux/Linux.sh <your sensor name> <ip address of your target system> <password of the user on target system> &
    For example:
    /opt/fim/scripts/Linux/Linux.sh temp_server1 1.1.1.1 password &
    "&" sign must be at the end of each line like this. The last line must also contain "& wait;" 
    Format for ASA's and switches:
    /opt/fim/scripts/Switch/Switch.sh <your sensor name> <ip address of your target system> <first password> <second password> &
  2.4. ONLY FOR *NIX SYSTEMS: create in /opt/fim/scripts/Linux/hosts_and_commands (for AIX - /opt/fim/scripts/AIX/hosts_and_commands) file with your sensor_name. This file must contain the command for performing scan on target system. Default command is already exist in example-file "temp_server1" in the archive
  2.5. Create user "fim" on target systems. You can create another user, but if so, you'll have to edit scripts
  2.6. Configure on yor server sendmail (make it work as client, not server. The process is properly described in the following   documentation: https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E52668_01/E54669/html/ol7-s7-emailsvc.html)
  2.7. Make sure you have installed on your server "expect" package
  2.8. To configure your mail addresses, you have to edit following scripts:
  /opt/fim/scripts/AIX/AIX.sh
  /opt/fim/scripts/ASA/ASA.sh
  /opt/fim/scripts/Linux/Linux.sh
  /opt/fim/scripts/Switch/Switch.sh
  In these scripts just find following lines
  From: fim@mail.com
  and
  To: admin@mail.com
  Just change them to your mail addresses.
  2.8. To start monitoring you can user fimctrl.sh in /opt/fim/bin. For example:
  ./fimctrl.sh start5min
  ./fimctrl.sh start 2min
  or (instead of written before)
  ./fimctrl.sh startall
  Just type ./fimsctrl.sh and you will see all available commands. ./fimctrl.sh status will show you the status of running jobs.
3. You can also temporarly to turn off or turn on your sensors. For that use script check_conf_switcher.sh. The format is:
  ./check_conf_switcher.sh <sensor name> off
  or
  check_conf_switcher.sh  <sensor name> on
  ./check_conf_switches.sh status - will show you status of all your sensors.
4. There is one another script check_conf_age.sh. I wrote it for monitoring, if information in my sensors is out of date. For example, if server is down, and sensor is running every 2min, after 270 seconds if you'll run check_conf_age.sh, it'll inform you that you sensor is down. You can call this script manually or automatically and also remotely, from monitoring system (for example PRTG - the output of this script I designed special for PRTG. You can edit it as you want, for example send mail, syslog and etc.). You can also make mail notification about connection problem changing "core" scripts. Just uncomment block #Report About Connection Problem via Mail in following scripts:
  /opt/fim/scripts/AIX/AIX.sh
  /opt/fim/scripts/ASA/ASA.sh
  /opt/fim/scripts/Linux/Linux.sh
  /opt/fim/scripts/Switch/Switch.sh  
5. Another useful thing - it's "alive" script. It's sending mail every 5 minutes, that your server properly sending mail to you. For example it's important if your mail server is down, and you don't know that. "core" script is /opt/fim/scripts/Alive/Alive.sh. In this script you can change mails and text of message.
6. Windows monitoring is working via agent, that uses GnuWin32 (http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/) and CygWin (https://www.cygwin.com/) utilities. More about these projects you can find on the sites above. The model of monitoring: agent works on remote server, and changes in OS and Registry are placing locally on remote server. FIM Server via sharing takes them from remote server and makes all necessary works. What you must to do to tune monitoring:
  6.1. First create sensor on FIM server (like Linux creation)
  6.2. In fim_2min.sh or fim_5min.sh (you want to use 2 or 5 minutes monitoring), just like Linux tuning, place line:
       /opt/fim/scripts/Windows/Windows.sh <your sensor name> <ip address of your target system> &
  6.3. On remote Windows server:
    6.3.1. Install Fim Client. Just press "Next" and Installation begins. Fim will be installed to C:\fim. The folder "fim" will be created by installation.
    6.3.2. Make sharing of the folder c:\fim\result. The name of sharing must be the same, as you called sensor on FIM Server.
    6.3.3. All setting are written in fim.bat file, if you want to use defaults, just run it (the best - place it in Scheduled Tasks with interval 1 minute). You can edit fim.bat as you want, monitoring uses "tree" and "grep" tools.
  6.4. On FIM Server:
    6.4.1. Create folder with the name of your Windows sensor in: /opt/fim/windows_shared/<sensor name>
    6.4.2. Under root user map shared folder on remote Windows server:
    mount -t cifs -o username=windows_user_that_have_rights_on_folder,password='password',uid=fim_user,gid=fim_group //<ip address of remote server>/<sensor name> /opt/fim/windows_shared/<sensor name>/
    For example:
  mount -t cifs -o username=guest,password='testpass',uid=fim,gid=fim //172.25.1.1/temp_server3 /opt/fim/windows_shared/temp_server3/
  6.5. Run you monitoring like Linux monitoring via /opt/fim/bin/fimctrl script
