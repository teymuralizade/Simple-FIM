Installation is simple also. 

1. Unzip archive on your server (which will monitor other systems; remind you - monitoring is agentless). For quick - let it be on /opt. So the path will be /opt/fim/
2. Create sensor. For that you must:
  2.1. Create directory in /opt/fim/sensors with the name of your sensor. For example /opt/fim/sensors/my_first_server. Inside of this directory create directory "hist" (without quotes)
  2.2. Deside - how often monitoring system will initialize connections to target systems for scan. My practice - frontends must be scan every 2 min, other systems 5 min. People often blame me in paranoia, but believe me I'm not. After desiding - write your sensor name in one of config - /opt/check_conf_age/2min.conf or /opt/check_conf_age/5min.conf
  2.3. In /opt/fim/bin 2 scripts - fim_2min.sh and fim_5min.sh. Edit one of them. We are interested in lines looks like:
    /opt/fim/scripts/Linux/Linux.sh... <some parameters>
    The format of this line for *nix systems is:
    /opt/fim/scripts/Linux/Linux.sh <your sensor name> <ip address of your target system> <password of the user on target system> &
    For example:
    /opt/fim/scripts/Linux/Linux.sh temp_server1 1.1.1.1 password &
    "&" sign must be at the end of each line like this. The last line must also contain "& wait;" 
    Format for ASA's and switches:
    /opt/fim/scripts/Switch/Switch.sh <your sensor name> <ip address of your target system> <first password> <second password> &
  2.4. ONLY FOR *NIX SYSTEMS: create in /opt/fim/scripts/Linux/hosts_and_commands (for AIX - /opt/fim/scripts/AIX/hosts_and_commands) file with your sensor_name. This file must contain the command for performing scan on target system. Default command is already exist in example-file "temp_server1" in the archive
  2.5.
